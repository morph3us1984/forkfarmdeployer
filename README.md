# forkfarmdeployer
This short script enables you to deploy a farm with ALL Chia forks in a single script. 

For further configuration I recommend using forktools*:

https://github.com/Qwinn1/forktools

*This script installs forktools if you do not comment out the line.

For the problem of solving port conflicts, I recommend using "forkports" which is part of forktools. I also use Pitchfork* to solve some port conflict before running any forks.

*This script installs PitchFork if you do not comment out the line.

You will need "git" to be installed on your linux. I recommend Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

sudo apt install git
